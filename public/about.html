<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Suraj Kumar Barnwal, a Computer Science Undergraduate from BIT,
  Sindri, Dhanbad. I am currently learning Data Strucutres and Algorithms from striver's
  DSA A2Z sheet and I am loving it. Also, I am learning Web Development from Angela Yu.
  I am a passionate curious person who always tries think of solving problems, making
  exciting useful projects. I have also mentored over 300 students on learning how to code
  in C++ in a week long class every evening under an event organized by the official
  coding club of BIT Sindri, i.e HnCC(Hackathon and Coding Club), this helped me improve
  my presentation, and soft skills drastically and also minimize the stage fear which has
  been present since me high-school days.
</p>

<p>I have worked on various projects, such as a Password-generator written in C++.
  This helped me get a good grasp of the programming language and epxlore the elegant file
  system of the Linux operating system. Similarly, I am also familiar with Machine learning
  and have some projects in my skill stack, these are:
  1. A flight-fare predictor.
  2. A heart-disease predictor.

<p>In my downtime I love reading books, watching webseries on Netflix. As a person I am
  really curious to knowing someone when they want to converse with them, I am easily
  able to connect with people and make them at their ease. I also love to spend some time
  with myself and my thoughts and pen them down. Most of my thoughts include the philosophy
  of Life, The Bhagwad Gita(Most useful book ever written) said by the God himself.
  I believe that I work hard and be consistent towards a perticular goal, I'll reach there
  eventually. This thought always pushes me forward in my life. Also, I follow the Dynamic
  programming approach of living, i.e don't forget the past or else I'll be Condemned to
  repeat it!
